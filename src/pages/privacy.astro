    <div class="prose prose-emerald max-w-none text-slate-600 leading-relaxed font-serif">
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">At Teacher Jake, we take student privacy seriously. We designed our tools to be learning-focused without unnecessary tracking or data collection.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 mt-10 mb-4 font-sans">1. Voice Recordings</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">Any voice recordings made during speaking and pronunciation activities are stored entirely <strong>locally on your device</strong> (such as your phone, tablet, or computer). These audio files are <strong>never</strong> sent to, processed by, or stored on our servers.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 mt-10 mb-4 font-sans">2. Student Results & Progress</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">By default, individual results, scores, and activity progress are not tracked or saved by our application in any database.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">The only exception is if a student enters a specific <strong>teacher code</strong> on a quiz. When a valid teacher code is provided and the quiz is submitted, the results are sent directly to that specific teacher's secure Google Sheet for grading purposes.</p>
      <p class="mb-6">Otherwise, students must show their generated "Report Card" directly to their teacher in person, or take a screenshot of their results, as this data is not stored off the device.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 mt-10 mb-4 font-sans">3. Website Analytics</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">We use cookie-free, privacy-friendly basic analytics strictly to measure overall anonymous page views and understand which worksheets are most helpful for our classes. We do not use analytics to track individual users, identify students, or follow anyone across the web.</p>
